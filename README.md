## Matlab Haar Cascade  

This Matlab extension that evaluates an OpenCV haar cascade inside Matlab.

To compile you will need Matlab and OpenCV installed in your machine. You will
need to adjust compile.m with the locations of OpenCV in your machine. The
distributed compile.m script is designed to compile against an statically
compiled OpenCV.

There is an example of usage of the Matlab extension in example.m.
